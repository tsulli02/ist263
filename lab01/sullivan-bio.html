My name is Tabitha Sullivan. I am a senior at Syracuse University studying information management technology with a concentration in digital retail strategies. After school I hope to work in ecommerce. I’m proficient in Python and SQL and got the chance to utilize my iSchool skills when I worked as a data management intern this past summer. When I’m not studying I like to spend time outdoors, running and skiing. I also love to spend time with my family as I am one of four, I have two little sisters and one older brother. I also have the largest dog breed in America, an English mastiff named Goose!
